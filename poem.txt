Goals in Life and Result Vs. System

This month is my birth month
I hope nexxt year will be the best year for me.
Chase your dreams, no matter how far,
Each step you take shows who you are.
Don't be afraid to step up Every day.
Goal are about the result you want to achieve.
Through struggles and trials, you'll find your way,
With courage and hope, rise every day.
But, Syatem are about theprocesses that least to those result.
